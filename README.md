# Univariate Segmentation in Diabetes

## Overview
This project explores the application of univariate segmentation techniques to identify key risk factors associated with diabetes. The analysis focuses on glucose levels, Body Mass Index (BMI), and age to differentiate between diabetic and non-diabetic populations. Using descriptive statistics and visualizations, this project provides actionable insights for early detection and risk management of diabetes.

## Objectives
- Analyze the distribution of glucose levels, BMI, and age in a diabetes dataset.
- Identify patterns and thresholds that indicate an increased risk of diabetes.
- Demonstrate the utility of univariate segmentation in healthcare data analysis.

## Dataset
The analysis uses the `diabetes_mellitus_study.csv` dataset, which includes the following variables:
- **case_id**: Unique identifier for each individual.
- **glucose_level**: Blood glucose levels (mg/dL).
- **blood_pressure**: Systolic blood pressure (mmHg).
- **insulin_level**: Blood insulin levels.
- **bmi**: Body Mass Index (kg/mÂ²).
- **gender**: Male or Female.
- **age**: Age of the individual (years).
- **outcome**: Diabetes diagnosis (1 = diabetic, 0 = non-diabetic).

## Analysis Techniques
- **Univariate Analysis**:
  - Descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.).
  - Visualizations (histograms, boxplots) to understand data distribution.
- **Key Variables**:
  - **Glucose Levels**: Analyze thresholds indicative of diabetes risk.
  - **BMI**: Explore the relationship between obesity and diabetes.
  - **Age**: Examine age as a demographic factor for diabetes prevalence.

## Results
- Diabetic individuals typically have higher glucose levels and BMI.
- Age plays a significant role, with older individuals showing higher diabetes prevalence.
- Univariate segmentation effectively highlights critical thresholds for early detection.
